<p class="thing">In Kate Wagner's blog titled "The Internet Feeds on Its Own Dying Dreams," she talks about her experiences with old technology, mainly focusing on the early days of the Internet. She basically says that the internet keeps changing and sometimes forgets about its own history. She's nostalgic about how the internet was in the 90s when it was all new and exciting. In the middle of her blog, Kate dives into how the internet's constant updates can make it lose important stuff from the past. She also mentions how the government might be using our fond memories of the old internet for their own purposes, like maybe keeping an eye on us. It's all about how technology changes how it affects our memories and who's in control. Kate's blog gives us a different way to think about how the internet has evolved and what it means for us. Kate uses imagery to help create that sense of nostalgia that we all know. Some things that she says, I agree with, and some things I disagree with.</p> 

<p class="thing">In the beginning of the blog, she introduces us to the fact that she has been around the age of the internet enough to understand it, but the internet gets more overwhelming when new things get updated, and life isn't the way it used to be anymore. Because google exists and needs to know what we browse and like and listen to the government is taking advantage of that also included with what we like from the past. She talks about this in the blog and says, "Like many people my age and older, I miss the pre–social media internet. The new internet knows this, and it capitalizes on my nostalgia as it eats away at the old internet. It amounts to an unforeseen form of technological cannibalism". And, when she says, "These disembodied ghosts&mdash;ancient in computer years&mdash;blink back at me because tech companies know that, based on my age, I like them". When she mentions "disembodied ghosts," she means that older websites, though old in computer years, still attract her because tech companies use her age to predict her interests. She goes more into this problem when she says, “The persistent erasure of what are essentially frozen experiences, snapshots of our lives, nakedly demonstrates how tech monopolies value the human commonality and user experience so loftily promoted in their branding&mdash;they don't. And this is especially true in an era where involuntary data mining, as opposed to voluntary participation, is king."</p>  

<p class="thing">Its sad how something can just exist and vanish just because more "foreign unsuspected people" disagree with how Myspace is good because Facebook is just easier to use and how all the got left behind in myspace were people who wouldn't let the internet change their perspective of originality, and how no one really cares about this anymore. She says, "This was partly because of the above&ndash;mentioned race and class biases (nobody wants to save that which is low class and uncool), but it was also because Myspace's user base comprised tweens and teens&mdash;young people eager to become adults. Myspace was soon to be known as "so middle school," a shameful period in our lives that we’d all rather forget. And gone it is. However, it's also worth noting that over time, the collective sentiment surrounding this shift has shifted as well. The world has moved on, and the significance of this digital evolution has diminished in the eyes of many. Just because it's not considered cool Is sad and the writer is right about some things. The end.</p>
