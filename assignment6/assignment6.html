  <header><h1>LGBTQ taught at elementary school</h1></header>

   <section id="article1">

     <p>Alex Parker, a 4th grade teacher at Cossitt Avenue Elementary School in La Grange, Illinois, has had discussions around LGBTQ topics in class after students brought up issues related to the community based on what they’ve come across in their lives. For instance, during Pride month students mentioned seeing rainbow flags and wanted to learn more about what it meant and how the LGBTQ community is accepted more broadly. Or when talking about the ways people can be discriminated against or mistreated because of aspects of their identity, students brought up how that can include who people choose to marry and how they see themselves, whether they are boys or girls, Parker said.</p>
     <p>But he admits that a lot of educators didn’t receive a ton of training within teacher preparation programs on how to foster such conversations. In many cases teachers never learned about LGBTQ topics when they were students themselves.</p>
	 <p>Topics like women’s history, or African American history have been part of the mainstream curriculum much longer so it can be easier to find resources, said Kathleen Barker, program director and lead facilitator for History UnErased. The idea of LGBTQ history as a field to teach in K-12 is often seen as a newer idea.</p>

	 <p> Okay, so to clarify something: I have nothing against LQBTQ I respect anyone who is gay. This is just for elementary schools. I remember I was working at Culver's, and it was around 9 pm and I had the duty of cleaning the bathroom and all of a sudden this guy comes in and i guess he thought i was gay because i was in the girls bathroom until he saw my apron of Culvers. He started a converstion of how he went to his daughter's university and how he was appalled at the fact that all the bathrooms in their were all-gender bathrooms and how he accepts anybody who is gay. I also agree with him but then he brought the fact that his son 3 weeks ago brought up being curious of what the rainbow flag is and what it represents and how other kids also asked in their class and the teacher didnt know how to respond without giving the wrong example. I agree that LQBTQ shouldn't be taught at elementary school BEACAUSE it intrupts the actual learning enviroments and with this youth's generation it'll just make them question it more. By the age of 13, they should know what they identify as. What gender they are attracted to like, if you identify as a girl(she/her), if they are trans(they/them).    </p>
	 <p> Another thing is teachers werent really taught about how to teach this to students.</p>
